A plugin for users to write a small text about the challenge that the admins can see.

To use this you need to somehow direct the user to the /writeup/<int: challengde_id> endpoint. I have included a modified view.js file you can put in the /CTFd/CTFd/plugins/challenges/assets/ directory that will redirect the user when they solve the challenge
